  <h2>Most notable</h2>
  <h5>Encanto</h5>
  <p>I had a brief obsession with this movie after I first watched it on Christmas of 2021. I decided I wanted to become more engaged as a movie watcher after seeing this. I might not be able to remember the plot now, but I watched this movie 4 times within a 2-week span. I bought the novel version of the movie and brought it to my college dorm but I have not read it yet.</p>

  <h5>Cinnamon the Movie</h5>
  <p>I watched this for the first time after trying to find cute content about the Sanrio character Cinnamoroll on YouTube. It turned out that this 43-minute movie is free to watch on YouTube. I really enjoyed it and wished that I had seen the movie during my childhood. I liked the themes of belonging and what family means. This was the first movie I watched with my girlfriend.</p>

  <h5>The Fox and the Hound</h5>
  <p>This was the second movie I watched with my girlfriend. This is one of her favorite childhood movies, and I enjoyed it a lot too. It made me really emotional at times. To me, it's a story of a strong friendship that survives the test of time and external factors that tried to get in the way. It's about choosing togetherness, connection, and forgiveness.</p>

  <h5>Level 16</h5>
  <p>I first saw a video summary of this movie on TikTok, but when I saw it while scrolling through Netflix, I decided to watch the entire thing. I wonder what it would be like to have watched the movie through without knowing about the big reveal at the end. It was generally eerie but I like movies like that: disturbing, but not shock-horror.</p>
